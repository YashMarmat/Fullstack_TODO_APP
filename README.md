# Note 1: Code Updation
This todo app is the updated version of Previous React Todo App (created in pure react js, link <a href="https://github.com/YashMarmat/TODO-APP-in-React">here</a>), a lot of code is being changed to manage both the performance and backend. I tried to keep the code as simple as possible. Also, one of the advantage of using django as a backend is the handling of ID's becomes much easier (no longer need to create seperate id's for each item, gets generated automatically by django).

# Note 2: Setting up the Application

after downloading/cloning the repository code follow below steps (keep the whole code in some directory/folder first):

1) Move in backend folder through terminal and run following commands

`pipenv install`

`pipenv shell`

`python manage.py runserver`

2) Move in frontend folder through terminal and run follwing commands

`npm i`

`npm start`

## All set ! Happy coding :)
